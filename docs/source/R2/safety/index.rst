Safety and Information
=================================================

**General Safety Information**

This User Guide contains important safety directions that should be followed during installation and operation
of Robo 3D printers. It also includes warnings against negligence and misuse that could cause damages or injuries.

It is essential to update the firmware so as to avoid any kind of failures. Visit our website: https://robo3d.com/ regularly to
see the latest news and updates.

Robo 3D printers operate at high temperatures and have easy to access movable components,
therefore, you must be particularly careful when handling or operating the devices. While operating
the printer, it is extremely important to avoid situations that may lead to burns or interference in proper
functioning.

Do not leave the machine unattended during the print job - check it periodically for proper functioning in
order to avoid potential accidents or failures. Turn off the printer once the print job is finished.
Monitor your printer for wear and tear regularly. Contact our Support Center at: http://help.robo3d.com/ for assistance while replacing worn or broken parts.

Keep the printer away from heat sources, fire, flammable materials, humidity as well as water and other
liquids. Place the machine away from any equipment emitting radiation. To prevent any inadvertent use,
keep the device out of reach of children and animals. Do not shake or drop the printer as it may
cause the printer to fail in performing as expected.

**Health and Safety during operation**

All service and maintenance activities as well as device operation require wearing safety gloves included
in the Starter Kit. Wearing safety gloves is also advised while removing the finished print from the platform.

The vapors released during the printing process are not hazardous, however, it is important to ensure
proper ventilation in the print room.

Food and beverages should be kept away from both the 3D printers and 3D printed objects.
While operating Robo devices, all measures regarding health and safety provided in this User Guide as
well as in separate regulations should be taken into account.

**Electrical Safety**

The Robo R2 3D printer has been tested for compliance with Low Voltage Directive. In order to ensure
the highest safety standards, including protection against short circuit, overload, overvoltage and
printer overheating, do not attempt to modify the printer and do not use electronic replacement parts
other than those recommended by the Manufacturer.

Replace electronic units according to the instructions and be particularly careful while using the tools
supplied with the printer.

Before plugging the power cable into the outlet, make sure that the power supply voltage in the outlet
matches the required value provided on the nameplate at the back of the printer. Avoid overloading the
outlet with too many devices.

The printer must be well-grounded. Always make sure that the ground complies with local and national
regulations.

Use only the original power cable supplied with the printer. Do not damage, cut or repair the cable.
A damaged cable should be immediately replaced with a new one.

All maintenance and repair work should be carried out while the device is off and unplugged. Do not
expose the device to moisture and liquids. Modifications such as soldering of electronic subunits are
forbidden.

**Mechanical Safety**

Robo 3D printers have movable components, such as the drive belts, Z-axis screw, extruder or build plate.
Therefore, do not reach into the printer or put anything inside the printer when it is running,
about to start running or at rest. This may lead to serious injuries or damages.

Tools and accessories from the Toolbox should be used with special care for intended purposes
only. Improper use may cause serious injuries.

Removing the prints from the platform should be done carefully so as to avoid injuries.

**Risk of Burns**

There is a high risk of burns while operating Robo printers as the hotend’s temperature may reach
up to 300⁰C [572⁰F]. Do not touch the hotend with bare hands. Be extremely careful during maintenance
and repair work of heated units. If it is necessary to touch a heated component, use the pliers
which are specially adapted for this purpose. Cooling of components should not take less than 30 minutes.

The platform’s temperature can reach up to 110⁰C [230⁰C], therefore, special care should be taken
while operating the printer or while removing the finished print.

**Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)**

Each Robo printer complies with Part 15 of the FCC rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:
(1) this device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference
received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.

This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used
in accordance with this instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio communications.
Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference.
