   - Before taking out your USB drive, make sure to eject it safely

From Model to your printer
   - There are two ways to get a file from your computer to you Robo C2 3D printer. Note that a 3d printable file is a .gcode file that you just created from the Cura for Robo desktop software

	- Tap on the upper left file icon

	- Tap on the cloud storage icon you saved your file to
	- Once in your cloud storage, find the file you just uploaded, and tap on it. This will 	bring you to a print page.
