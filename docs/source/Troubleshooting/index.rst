Print Not Sticking to Bed
---------------

If you are experiencing problems with the plastic not adhering to your print bed, there are a few things that can be done;

1. Update
  * Make sure to update your printer to the latest version of the software. This will ensure that you have the latest version of the firmware that is flashed to your controller board, and have the most up-to-date and tested version of build plate leveling.
2. Re-run the z-offset wizard
  * Re-running the z-offset wizard will make sure that your bed is properly leveled. To do this, on the menu screen go to Utilities> Wizards>Z-offset Wizard. 
3. Replace the build plate adhesion
  * After some time, the build plate adhesion can become unsticky and plastic will no longer be able to stick to it. Replace this with the black tape that came with your printer or order more from our store at www.robo3d.com. Unpeel the used build tape from the build plate, and replace with a new, fresh peice. Remember to re-calibrate your offset by selecting the z-offset qizard from the utilities menu.
4. Using a raft
   * Make sure to use a raft on all of your parts when preparing your print. This will allow a bigger surface area of plastic to stick to the bed, and can compensate for a small amount of unlevel bed.
