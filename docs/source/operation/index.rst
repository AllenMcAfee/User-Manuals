Using print bed adhesion

The Robo C2 has a print bed adhesion tape already installed with your printer. These will usually last about 10-30 prints depending on the model you print on it.
   - In order to make sure you get good adhesion of your print, make sure to wipe the print bed adhesion with isopropyl alcohol before every print.
   - If your prints have a hard time sticking to the bed, you can replace the print bed adhesion with the extras that came in your inclusions box or buy directly from www.robo3d.com store

------------
Removing the print
------------

   1. When the Print is completed, remove the print plate with the finished print on it from the C2 by lifting the bed up and away from the magnets. 
   2. Slowly slide the print bed out of the machine and hold with two hands on opposite ends of the print plate. 
   3. Now, flex the print plate back and forth to create a gap in between the print and the print plate. Move to the opposite corners and repeat twisting until the majority of the print has come loose.
   4. Carefully remove the print from the print plate with your hand.
   
.. note:: If the print is not coming loose after flexing the bed, use the provided spatula scraper carefully to skim the border of your print. Slowly work your way underneath the print toward the middle until your print comes loose. Do not try and pull the print from the plate directly up from the middle, as it may cause your print to break.
