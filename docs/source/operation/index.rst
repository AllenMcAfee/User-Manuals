Print Status

There are three ways to check on the status of your print while your Robo C2 is at work printing away

Screen

Robo App
   - If you have the Robo App, you can check on the status of your print by selecting the printer under the 'Dashboard' tab This will indicate the name of the file printing, what percentage done your print is, along with the nozzle temperature

Web app
   - If you have a web browser on your computer or mobile device, you can check on the status of your print by navigating to its IP address in the navigation bar of the browser
   - To see the IP address of your printer, select 'Utilities' from the home screen
   - Next select 'Network'
   - Then select 'IP Address' and note the IP address of your Robo C2
   - Copy that number into your navigation bar, and it will bring you to a web app to see all things with your Robo C2

Using print bed adhesion
-----------

The Robo C2 has a print bed adhesion tape already installed with your printer. These will usually last about 10-30 prints depending on the model you print on it.
   - In order to make sure you get good adhesion of your print, make sure to wipe the print bed adhesion with isopropyl alcohol before every print.
   - If your prints have a hard time sticking to the bed, you can replace the print bed adhesion with the extras that came in your inclusions box or buy directly from www.robo3d.com store

Removing the print
------------

   - When the Print is completed, remove the print plate with the finished print on it from the C2 by lifting the bed up and away from the magnets. 
   - Slowly slide the print bed out of the machine and hold with two hands on opposite ends of the print plate. 
   - Now, flex the print plate back and forth to create a gap in between the print and the print plate. Move to the opposite corners and repeat twisting until the majority of the print has come loose.
   - Carefully remove the print from the print plate with your hand.
   - Note: if the print is not coming loose after flexing the bed, use the provided spatula scraper carefully to skim the border of your print. Slowly work your way underneath the print toward the middle until your print comes loose. Do not try and pull the print from the plate directly up from the middle, as it may cause your print to break.
