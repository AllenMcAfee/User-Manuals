Unboxing Robo C2
---------------

Now that you've received your Robo C2, it's time to unbox it and get familiar with your printer and accessories.

Your C2 is housed in 3 styrofoam pieces, secured together by a nylon strap. Simply lift the printer from the box using the strap and set it down. Unclip the black nylon strap and remove the two halves of the top styrofoam shell. Finally, using the handholds on the bottom of your C2, lift the printer out of the bottom styrofoam piece.

.. tip:: Save your printer box, nylon strap, foam inserts, and inclusions box. You will need the original packaging to exercise your warranty or ship your printer in the future.

The printer's accessories are stored in the inclusions box inside the printer. Simply slide the inclusion box out and be sure to remove the foam.  

Register your Robo C2
---------------
Before you start, please register your Robo C2 for any servicing or warranty needs if they’re ever required. You can register your product by visiting robo3d.com/register.

Initial set-up
---------------
Now let’s move forward with your initial set-up of Robo C2.

First, insert the spool holder into the rear slot of the printer.

Loading filament
---------------

To begin loading filament, hang your filament spool on the spool holder.

   :align: center

Be sure to unroll at least 11”— or 30 centimeters — of filament and thread it through the base of the filament sensor block and into the filament feed tube.

   :alt: Select Filament Loading Wizard
   :align: center

And then follow the on-screen prompts, which will include:

- Heating up the printer
- Ensuring you’ve cut off the tip of the filament
- Having the filament feed through until you see it coming from the nozzle
- Pressing NEXT, and
- Pressing FINISHED

Calibration and setting Z offset
---------------

Next you’ll want to calibrate Robo C2 by selecting UTILITIES on the touch screen, and then select WIZARDS from the list.

.. image:: /docs/source/images/3.1.png

   :align: center
   
From here you’ll select Z OFFSET WIZARD.

.. image:: /docs/source/images/3.3.png
   :alt: Select Z Offset Wizard
   :align: center

And then follow the on-screen prompts, which include:
 
- Waiting for the printer to calibrate its home position
- Pressing up and down on the [insert descriptor] buttons while sliding a piece of paper between the nozzle and the print bed until you feel some resistance against the paper
- Pressing FINISHED

Note that you will see the offset progress and completion on the touchscreen.

The test print
---------------

To create your first test print Select FILES on the home screen. Then select a file to print from the list.

.. image:: /docs/source/images/4.1.png
   :alt: Select Files on Home Screen

Removing the test print
---------------

When the test print is complete and cooled down, remove the print bed with the finished print still in place by lifting the bed up and away from the magnets.

Slowly slide the print bed out of the machine with both hands.

Now, carefully flex the print bed from several positions to help loosen the print from the print bed.

Repeat this process until the most of the print is loose from the bed.

Carefully remove the print from the print bed with your hand.

Note that if the print is not coming loose after flexing the print bed, put the bed back in Robo C2 and use the provided spatula to carefully remove the print at its borders. Then slowly work your way underneath the print until it’s loose. Don’t force the print loose by pulling it up directly up from the print bed, since this may cause your print to break.

Connecting to Wi-Fi
---------------

We highly recommend connecting Robo C2 to your Wi-Fi network. Doing so provides you with necessary updates that allows for a more enjoyable 3D printing experience.


.. note:: You can also use the provided Ethernet cable (LAN) to connect Robo C2 directly to your Wi-Fi network.
