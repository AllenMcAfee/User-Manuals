Unboxing Robo C2
---------------

Now that you've received your Robo C2, it's time to unpack and get familiar with your printer and accessories.


Your C2 is housed in 3 styrofoam pieces, secured together by a nylon strap. Simply lift the printer out of the box by the strap and set it down.  Unclip the black nylon strap and remove the two halves of the top styrofoam shell.  Finally, using the handholds on the bottom of your C2, lift the printer out of the bottom styrofoam piece.

.. tip:: Save your printer box, nylon strap, foam inserts, and inclusions box. You will need the original packaging to exercise your warranty or ship your printer in the future.

The printer's accessories are stored in the inclusions box inside the printer.  Simply slide the inclusion box out and be sure to remove the foam.
