Unboxing Robo R1+ Plus

Now that you've received your Robo R1+ Plus, it's time to unbox it and get familiar with your printer and accessories.

The printer's accessories are stored in the top foam piece of the printer. Remove these pieces from the top foam.

Your R1+ Plus is housed in 4 styrofoam pieces, one on top, one on bottom, and two from the sides. Simply lift the top foam piece off and set to the side. Now lift the printer out with two hands and set on your desktop.

Now we are ready to take out the inner packing material. There are 4 pieces of foam that we need to take out. Two on the sides of the printer, and two just below the glass build plate. Go ahead and slide those out.

.. tip:: Save your printer box and foam inserts for transportation. Also, you might need the original packaging to exercise your warranty or ship your printer in the future.

Initial set-up
---------------

Now let’s move forward with your initial set-up of Robo R1+ Plus.

Inside the toolbox, there are four small rubber feet; these attach to the corners of your printer to make sure it doesn't slide around your desk when printing. Place one on each corner.

From here, we will want to make sure our voltage is set correctly. On the back of the printer, there is a voltage switch that has two settings: 110 or 220V depending on which country you are using the R1+ Plus. Make sure it is compatible with your country code. You can use the end of one of the included allen wrenches to slide the switch.

From here you’ll want to connect the power cord to the designated area on the back of the printer and then plug it into an AC outlet. Now go ahead and turn on the printer.

Before you begin a print you need to load filament. Follow these steps to properly load your printer with filament.

Take the spool holder that came with your printer and put it on by simply sliding it onto one of the arms of the top plastic.

   :alt: Settings
   :align: center

You can either click the PREHEAT button to preheat the print to a default temperature of 210C. Or create your own presets by clicking the pencil next to Extruder Temperature.

If you choose to create your own preset, a new Window will popup after clicking the pencil. In this window you can set up to 3 custom presets. Once you name the preset and designate a temperature press Save.

   :alt: preset
   :align: center

After you click PREHEAT or one of your own presets, you should notice the target temperature to change to your desired temperature.
.. note:: You can preheat and create presets for the bed as well but it's not necessary to load filament.

While that is heating up, hang your filament spool on the spool holder.

Be sure to unroll at least 11”— or 30 centimeters — of filament and cut the tip with a pair of scissors.

 Now you're ready to start printing!

 ---------------
The first print.
 ---------------

Now to start your first print. You can either load your own file, or choose one of the preloaded prints inside the local library. To print one of the preloaded files, navigate to the library tab and then select the Local Library.

  :alt: library
  :align: center

Before you start a print, make sure to double check your slicing settings. To do that, under Settings & Control, select Settings. For most of the preloaded prints, default settings will suffice and all you need to do is make sure the Material you loaded the printer and desired print quality are correct. For more advanced prints and geometries, you may need to edit the slice settings to ensure a perfect print.

Once you select a file and finalize your settings press PRINT and your print will begin preheating. Your R1 will then begin printing as soon as the printer is completely preheated!

Removing the first print
---------------

When the test print is complete and cooled down, use the provided spatula to carefully remove the print at its borders. Then, slowly work your way underneath the print until it’s loose. Don’t force the print loose by pulling it up directly up from the print bed, since this may cause your print to break.
