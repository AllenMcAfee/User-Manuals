Unboxing Robo R1+ Plus

The printer's accessories are stored in the top foam piece of the printer. Remove these pieces from the top foam.

Your R1+ Plus is housed in 4 styrofoam pieces, one on top, one on bottom, and two from the sides. Simply lift the top foam piece off and set to the side. Now lift the printer out with two hands and set on your desktop.

Now we are ready to take out the inner packing material. There are 4 pieces of foam that we need to take out. Two on the sides of the printer, and two just below the glass build plate. Go ahead and slide those out.

.. tip:: Save your printer box and foam inserts for transportation. Also, you might need the original packaging to exercise your warranty or ship your printer in the future.

Initial set-up
---------------

Now let’s move forward with your initial set-up of Robo R1+ Plus.

Inside the toolbox, there are small rubber feet; these attach to the corners of your printer to make sure it doesn't slide around your desk when printing. Place one on each corner.

From here, we will want to make sure our voltage is set correctly. On the back of the printer, there is a voltage switch from 110-220V depending on which country you are using the R1+ Plus. Make sure it is compatible with your country code.

To begin loading filament, click on the 'pre-heat' button within MatterControl to begin heating up your nozzle.

While that is heating up, hang your filament spool on the spool holder. Be sure to unroll at least 11”— or 30 centimeters — of filament and cut the tip with a pair of scissors. Thread it through the top of the filament passing hole at the top of your printer and into the extruder. You may need to pull back the filament thumb latch in order to create and opening and feed it all the way down.

You may spin the filament drive gear by hand to push the filament down, into the nozzle, and out the other end. Once you see this, your filament is successfully loaded.

The first print

Finally, select the file you just added to your queue and click 'Print'.

Note that you can select PAUSE to pause your print, or you can select CANCEL to cancel your print.

---------------
Removing the first print
---------------

When the test print is complete and cooled down, use the provided spatula to carefully remove the print at its borders. Then, slowly work your way underneath the print until it’s loose. Don’t force the print loose by pulling it up directly up from the print bed, since this may cause your print to break.
