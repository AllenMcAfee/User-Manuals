To get your 3d prints out looking great, Cura for Robo Desktop Software is the recommended software. This software takes your 3d models, and turns them into a language that the Robo C2 can read, and uses it to product an object

Downloading and Installing Desktop Software
   - The Cura for Robo Desktop Software is included in your USB drive that came with your printer, and is also available at www.robo3d.com/software
   - Download the latest version of Cura for Robo for your operating system. This software is easily supported by Windows Vista or higher, Mac OSX 10.7 or higher, and Ubuntu 14.04 or higher operating systems. (put logos of operating systems here)  
   - Open the installer and follow the on screen installation instructions
   - Once opened, select Robo C2 3d Printer to get the correct configuration for your machine

Downloading and importing a file into the software
   - Open your web browser and go to a 3d file sharing site. We recommend either www.thingiverse.com or www.youmagine.com for getting free, online 3d models.
   - Browse around and choose a model you like
   - Download the .stl version of the 3d model and save it somewhere you can retrieve it easily on your computer
   - In your Cura for Robo Desktop Software, click on the ‘Load’ button and choose your .stl file you just saved. This will insert your model onto the platform in the software.
