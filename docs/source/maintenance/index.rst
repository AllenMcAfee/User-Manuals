#Robo C2 Maintenance


Remember, a well-maintained Robo C2 is a happy one! 


Be sure to check for the following before you print:
   - Make sure the print bed is free of any/all objects
   - Make sure nothing is blocking the extruder head from moving freely around the build area.
   - Make sure no objects are below the print bed that could prevent it from freely moving up and down.
   - Make sure there are no broken pieces of filament within the extruder.
   - Make sure all cords are neatly tucked away to avoid unnecessary accidents while the printer’s in operation. 
   - Make sure all of your software is up to date (on screen prompts will let you know when updates are available, but only if you are connected to a Wi-Fi network). 


And to ensure the best 3D printing experience now and in the future, use the following Robo C2 maintenance tips regularly (every 6-12 months, depending on use):


[Let’s create animated gifs for the steps]

-----

Steps to take to clean your feeder gear
   1. Make sure to turn your Robo C2 off, and unplug the power cord from the back of the machine
   2. Remove the extruder cap on the top of your extruder assembly (gif for this)
   3. Take a waire brush, toothbrush, or something similar, and brush the feed gear to remove debris
   4. Rotate the feeder gear by turning the motor shaft by hand and repeat steps until the entire feeder gear is cleaned
   5. Place the extruder cap back onto the top of your extruder assembly and plug in Robo C2

Lubricating the axis (gif of lubing rods)
-----

There are two types of linear rods, and two types of bearings in Robo C2, and they must be lubricated differently to ensure best prints.

White Lithium Grease
   - The rods that carry the extruder head are ball bearings and should be lubed with a white-lithium grease to ensure smooth travel.
   - The z-axis lead screw also needs a white lithium grease for lubrication. Dap a small amount onto the rod, and let the printer move up and down from the next print to lubricate itself.

3-in-1 Oil
   - The x and y brackets have a smooth bushing inside of them, and need to be lubricated once every 2-4 months. Wipe down the build up that these bearing produce on the rods over time with a cleaning agent. The bearings can be greased with a few drops of 3-in-1 oil, or sewing machine oil to lubricate sufficiently.

Cleaning the print bed surface
-----

- The Robo C2 print bed surface is a sheet of black painters tape. Make sure to clean it with rubbing alcohol to ensure your print sticks to its surface. (gif of cleaning)
- After 15 or 20 prints, you may need to replace this sheet if you see that your prints are not sticking to it. Ensure that the print sheet is laid completely flat on the build platform, and that it is flush and level across the surface. (gif of applyling new build tape)
- When you run out of print surfaces, you can order more at www.robo3d.com or use your own.
- When removing and replacing the entire print bed, double check that its magnets align with the magnets on the platform to ensure it is seated correctly. Build platforms that aren’t seated correctly will result in failed prints. (gif of removing print bed and aligning magnets)


Removing your Hotend Nozzle
-----
Follow these steps to remove your hotend nozzle
   1. Make sure to turn your Robo C2 off, and unplug the power cord from the back of the machine
   2. Remove the magnetic extruder plate to expose your entire hotend and wires
   3. Take the 3mm Allen Key that came in your tool kit and loosen the hex screw that is on the aluminum plate just above your hotend
   4. When the hex screw is loose enough, your hotend should be able to fall out of its housing
   5. Carefully pull the wires by hand to remove them from their housings
   6. Place new hotend in by reversing these steps
   7. Plug your Robo C2 back in and you are all set
