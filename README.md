###How to edit content

Each section is controlled by a index.rst file that is located under the section's directory.  For example: ```/docs/source/software/index.rst```  Content in these files can be edited using markdown language.  

Menu items are derived from the TOC tree in the primary index file ```/docs/index.rst```.  For more information for the TOC tree, documentation is located here:http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.4.9/markup/toctree.html
